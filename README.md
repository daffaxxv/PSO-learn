# PSO-learn
This is the best step where you can learn Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in python

## Files Inside
### 1. pso.py
- the basis of PSO computation with RMSE as the cost function
- the function of y_i where we want to estimate yi to y

### pso_learning.ipynb
allows you to change the input, but dont forget to change the 'myfun' in pso.py to fit with your 'y'

dependencies: matplotlib, numpy
